# SFI-GCN - Multimodal Brain Network Analysis

This project employs SFI-GCN for the task of gender classification and predicting cognitive scores using data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP).

## Contents
- `Generating_Results_From_Runs`: Code for compiling results from model runs.
- `Generating_Y_Datasets`: Scripts for generating the required datasets from the HCP metadata.
- `PredictingCognitiveScores`: Code for predicting cognitive scores using various models.
- `PredictingGender`: Code for gender classification using various models.

Each subdirectory contains its own README with detailed explanations and usage instructions.

## Usage
To run any of the code in the subdirectories, navigate to the corresponding directory and follow the instructions in the respective README files.

## Results
Results from the executions will be outputted to the specified directories as set up in the script configurations. The results include predictions and model evaluations.
